Installation Instructions DVRPTR Control Center for LINUX
=========================================================

The executable file for Linux and Windows is the same file,
this file is running on both systems.

Under Windows just start the exe file.

Under Linux a couple of step have to be done to prepare
the system for DVRPTR:

Linux Distribution used: Ubuntu 10.10-alternate

This distribution runs reliably even an small, slow systems like
the Fujitsu/Siemens Thinclient and others.

Memory: 510 MB recommended
CPU: minimum 500 MHz

1) Install this Ubuntu version and test if it is running properly
2) Open the Synaptic Installer and install the package mono-complete

usually this should be all to do. Unfortunately the package mono-complete
has a bug (October 2011), and a patch must be installed:

3) download the file:  http://miszacus.net/files/UiaAtkBridge.dll.zip
4) unzip it and copy UiaAtkBridge.dll into the folder:
   /usr/lib/mono/gac/UiaAtkBridge

Now your Ubuntu System is ready to run DVRPTR Control Center:

5) copy dvrptr.exe to your home folder  /home/yourname
6) go into your home folder and start mono and give dvrptr.exe as parameter:
   mono dvrptr.exe
7) There is no need to install a driver. Just connect the DVRPTD board to USB.
8) The device /dev/ttyACM0 (or 1,2 or 3) appears when the board is connected. 
   Choose this device name in the "Modem" tab.

The Linux installation runs more robust and reliable as the Windows version.
If you plan to build a repeater, linux is the better choice.

For home use you can use Windows or Linux.
