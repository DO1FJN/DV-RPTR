
DV-RPTR Bootloader
------------------

The DV-RPTR Board is shipped with a DFU V1.1 compatible bootloader. You can
DOWN- and UPload a firmware file using a USB connection or a serial link.
Serial (RS232 115200baud 8N1) is available only as TTL compatible signals on
expandion port SV2. Use a level shifter to connect RxD, TxD on a RS232 PC port.

The bootloader program is almost the same like the loaders from DV-Modem and
DV-ATRX. To activate in a firmware program, set the ISP force fuse and reboot.

Activation external / force:
To force the loader program, set a jumper on expansion I/O20 to GND (Pin13-14
at SV2) and connect power.

LED signaling:
RED flashes slowly   - bootloader standby (IDLE)
GREEN flashes slowly - USB connected, standby
RED flashes fast     - indicating flash memory write operations
YELLOW               - bootloader change to serial link mode

After 30s in IDLE mode the loader turns off LEDs (POWERDOWN mode).
