
Bootloader HowTo
----------------

What you need for an firmware udpate (USB DFU):

1. LibUSB win32:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/libusb-win32/

2. dfu-util (openMoko) Windows version:
http://projects.openmoko.org/projects/dfu-util-win32/	(in the moment offline)

3. INF file ("driver")
This file can be created with the "inf-wizard" tool supplied with LibUSB.

Build the INF file
------------------

Unzip 'libusb-win32-bin-1.2.x.x.zip' into a exsiting folder (it contains a sub-
folder 'libusb-win32-bin-1.2.x.x').

Connect your DFU compatible device and power it up in bootloader mode.
Example DV-RPTR: Set 'force bootloader' jumper, connect it with power + USB.

start 'libusb-win32-bin-1.2.x.x\bin\inf-wizard.exe'

in the dialog, select the device, you want do build a driver for.

---

Reconnect USB cable to your device.

Now you can install this new driver for it: The libusb will be copied into your
Windows system folders.


Using dfu-util for update:
--------------------------
(libusb-win32 is correctly installed for your USB-DFU device)

Connect your DFU compatible device and power it up in bootloader mode.
Example DV-RPTR: Set 'force bootloader' jumper, connect it with power + USB.

Save your firmware file into a folder (fw-folder).
open a command window (cmd.exe).
Type <drive>:\<dfu-util-folder>\dft-util.exe -D <fw-folder>\<firmware file>
Wait 2-4 seconds until the new firmware is flashed.

Disconnecd your DFU device from power and reconneced it without a 
'force bootloader' jumper (for example).

Problems:
--------
1. more than one DFU devices exists in your system (example Lenovo R500 notebook)
   Solution: use additional parameter "-d" and type the usb vendor / product ID
   Example: "-d 0x0403:0x92AE" for the DV-RPTR.
2. Download hangs at start.
   Solution: Its a issure of dfu-util. Try again after a new power up.
